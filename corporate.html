			<p><strong>Improving Dog Owners' User Experience</strong>


</p>
   
      We asked participants through our solution interviews to test our website prototype in order to get helpful feedback. 
			<br>
			<br>
We asked six people, all of them are devoted dog owners who understand the difficulty of finding a balance between their time with their animals.
<p>⁠Our goals was - find out if the website is functual and easy to use without any difficulties or confussion for the page visitor. </p>
			<p>The instructions were simple. At first we let them interact freely with the website.</p>
			
<p>Then 3 tasks were given: </p>
			<ol>
			<li>Find the section that explains the brand's vision</li>
				<li>Subscribe to the "Busier Luxe" subscription plan</li>
				<li> Find our Instagram page</li>
			
			</ol>
			
Several important points were brought to light via feedback:
<ul>
<li>User Experience: Participants complimented the website's flow and user interface, highlighting the information's accessibility and ease of use. </li>

<li>Design components that Engage: The design components were praised for their friendliness and warmth, which successfully connected with the target demographic.</li>


	<li>There were missing icons for the subscriptions (different icon for each bundle).</li> </ul>



<p>Since our feedback it is yet to be decided on how to design the icons for each subscription. Another improvement that has been made is to gather more information in one page, meaning that there aren’t separate pages/hyperlinks for each individual thing. Instead, we included more dropdown menus and rearranged our paragraphs. A ''Meet our Team'' section should be addd to introduce the people that would be taking care of the pet.</p>

          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
 
			<p id="marketing-5" class="fw-bold">About us </p>

We're all about inclusivity and building a community where every pup - young or old, big or small - is welcomed with open arms. Let's create meaningful connections, let us entertain your dog!  </p>

<p>Our Target Audience is Dog Owners between 25 and 40 years old, living in the Netherlands – Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Breda, Utrecht, Eindhoven and Den Hague, have full-time jobs, have a family/family orientated, middle to upper class, opened to frequent travels. From the interviews that we did with our target audience we found out the following problems: 
 </p>
<ul><li>Busy and Guilty Dog Owners: Owners feel guilty due to lack of time to entertain their dogs adequately, leading to feelings of neglect and concern for their pets' well-being. </li> 
<li>Loneliness and Boredom: Dogs experience boredom, sadness, or loneliness due to lack of mental and physical stimulation.  
</li><li>Lack of Socialization: Dogs miss out on essential socialization opportunities, leading to behavioural issues and anxiety.  
	</li>	</ul>	
			
			<p id="marketing-7" class="fw-bold">In our platform we offer the following services:  </p>
 
			<ul>

			<p id="marketing-9" class="fw-bold">Social Media Choice </p>
 
<p>The target audience is busy dog owners between 25 and 40, who use social media to stay updated on events, follow their favorite brands or purely for entertainment after a long workday. Instagram is the platform with the biggest percentage (46%) of users amongst the ages 25 to 44 (Instagram: Distribution of Global Audiences 2024, by Age Group, 2024). From our interviewees all 6 use Instagram, 5 have Facebook but don’t use it and 1 has Snapchat. For this marketing campaign we will focus solely using Instagram, as our interviewee mentioned that they hardly ever open Facebook. </p>
 
<p>Even though most Instagram users are slightly younger, many people in the 25–40 age range still regularly use the app to share pictures and videos of their pets, especially dogs. They take pleasure in following accounts that post content about dogs, including adorable dog pictures, training advice, and motivational tales. In addition, they might use Instagram to meet other dog lovers and owners who share their interests and to learn about the latest trends in dog grooming, training, and care. </p>
 		
	<p id="marketing-10" class="fw-bold">Objectives </p>
	<ul>		
	<li>Reach 250 accounts by March 31st, 2024. People already know a brand's visibility, reputation, and message when they come across it for the first time (Edelman, 2023). A reach of 250 people is enough to make a good impression of the brand’s trust and community. </li> 
<li>Affect – Dog owners are interested and want to develop better relationship with their dogs and attend the weekly classes, so that they don’t regret not spending quality time later. We want our audience to rethink their bond with their dogs. With frequent posting and interactive stories, we want to update the followers on important news and have them interact with the brand. We believe that in the timeframe of our campaign we can create a community of responsible dog owners that want to improve the connection with their pet. </li> 
<li>Response </li>
		<ul><li>An average of 300 views on Instagram reels.  </li>
			<li>An average of 300 views on Instagram reels. </li>
<li>An average of 1 comment on each post. Additionally, a study involving 123,410 Instagram profiles reveals that users with up to 1000 followers only receive a maximum of one comment per post each day (Bieldfeldt, 2021). </li>
<li>An average of 25 to 30 likes per post. In the previously mentioned studies, Bielfeldt (2021) and Erxleben (2021) found that small Instagram accounts with up to 1000 followers receive no more than five likes every day. </li>
<li>An average of 2 saves per post. 
		  </li></ul>
		
<li>Campaign</li>
	<ul><li>In a post, we presented our vision, values, and brand. to aid in the accomplishment of our affect goal by inspiring brand excitement and fostering a sense of brand loyalty in our audience. Communicating our values also makes it easier for us to draw in clients who hold similar values. </li>
<li>Reels: to meet our Reach goals, we exchanged dog-related reels. To encourage audience participation, we also presented our story reels featuring interactive questions. In one reel, we also gave a team introduction. </li>
<li>Posts that provide details about our website and services. These posts increase excitement and help us establish our brand's credibility. They advertise our service and brand. </li>
<li>We used longer, more in-depth captions for all posts and reels to help increase viewer attention and engagement. To make all our posts and reels easier to find, we also included hashtags. 
		</li>
		</ul> </ul>	
			
<p id="marketing-11" class="fw-bold">Content Calendar</p>	
			
<img src="images/marketing calendar.png" class="img-persona" alt="">
			<br>
			<br>
			
	<p>In the beginning we posted 3 times at once to get as much reach as possible. Also, we wanted to have a few posts on display when people open the page and it is not something empty with just one post. We did this for two weeks and afterwards we spread the 3 posts throughout the week to focus not only on gaining new followers, but also retaining the current ones’ interest. </p>
 
<p>In the first week, on the 8th of April, we posted at noon around 13:00 and in the second week, the 15th of April, we decided to make a change and post at around 18:00-19:00. Afterwards we saw that the reach and engagement on the posts that were shared later was higher, so we continued uploading our content mainly after 17:00-18:00.  Additionally, we spaced out the reel postings to guarantee higher interaction. To further advance the branding of our company, we have included additional posts that provide details about our website and app. To encourage greater audience engagement with our brand, we have included more stories that include interactive polls and questions.  </p>
			
<p id="marketing-12" class="fw-bold">Instagram Execution</p>
			
<img src="images/feed.png" class="img-persona img-fluid" alt="">
			

			<p>To keep our posts organized and cohesive we chose to use the following 3 colors – redish/brown, green, and black. Those are also the main colors of our website. The logo is a dog’s paw, and we chose to use it as our profile picture. Most of the posts have small paws as design elements.  </p>
			
<img src="images/colors.jpg" class="img-persona img-fluid img-thumbnail" alt="">
			<br>
			<br>
			
		<p>We posted 3 instagram reels. The first one was introducing our team as different dog breeds that match our personalities. We made it fun and relateble so that people can comment what breed they think they are. The second reel was made with the intetntion to evoke sympathy in the viewers. We chose a slow piano sound, put text about how no dog should be left alone and later inrtoduced our services and how we can make the dogs’ life more fun. In the description we described in detail our membership plans. The third reel was about interesting facts about dogs. We used stock footage of cute dogs and puppies. This reel had less views but it had better engagment with comments and saves.  </p>

	<img src="images/tips.jpeg" class="img-persona img-fluid" alt="">	

			<p>“Training tips and tricks: </p> 
 
<p>1.Start Early: Begin training your dog as soon as you bring them home, regardless of their age. Puppies are like sponges and can learn quickly, but even adult dogs can learn new behaviors with patience. </p>
<p>2.Use Positive Reinforcement: Reward good behavior with treats, praise, toys, or affection. Positive reinforcement encourages your dog to repeat the desired behavior. Avoid punishment-based methods as they can lead to fear and aggression. </p>
<p>3.Be Consistent: Establish consistent rules and expectations for your dog. Use the same commands and gestures each time you train. Consistency helps your dog understand what is expected of them. </p>
<p>4.Keep Training Sessions Short: Dogs have short attention spans, so keep training sessions brief, around 10-15 minutes, several times a day. This helps maintain their focus and prevents them from getting bored or frustrated. </p>
<p>5.Be Patient: Training takes time and patience. Remember that every dog learns at their own pace. Stay calm and avoid becoming frustrated if your dog doesn’t grasp a concept right away.</p> 
<p>6.Use High-Value Treats: Use small, tasty treats that your dog loves to reinforce good behavior. Reserve these treats for training sessions to make them more enticing. </p>
 
<p>PFFFF, IT IS A LOT, RIGHT? SO, LEAVE IT TO US, WE CAN DO IT INSTEAD OF YOU! CHOOSE PAWPALS’’ CLUB AND JOIN OUR LIVE TRAININGS! </p>

<p>“We believe that in the timeframe of our campaign we can create a community of responsible dog owners that want to improve the connection with their pet.”- In just four weeks, we think we've established a small but mighty community that supports our brand. Our followers participated actively in the interactive polls we posted on many of the stories we shared, which included questions. We attempted to reply to the few direct messages we also received in less than an hour. We also got compliments on the way our feed looked and how our values were received in those direct messages, which we think indicates that we have gained the respect and loyalty of our followers.</p>  
 
<p>The main takeaway is that many people have made a shift in their behavior with their dogs. People that we had interviewed, and close friends mentioned that once we brought up all those problems, they had acted on them. We even had a direct message from a person that was very interested in our services.  </p>
			
		  <p class="fw-bold">Response</p>
<ul><li>
	An average of 300 views on Instagram reels. We surpassed this goal and averaged 440 views on each reel, which for a new account and not posting every single day is a great reach. </li> 
<li>An average of 1 comment on each post. This goal wasn’t that difficult to achieve when we got to post regularly and had a better reach. Although the goal is achieved, we believe that we should have made better call to action in the posts’ captions/descriptions. Also, the content really matters, as some of our latest posts received more comments, because we improved the content. </li>
<li>An average of 25 to 30 likes per post. Most of our posts got more than 50 likes. We were very surprised with this result, as it means that based on reach, we have around 15% engagement rate and based on followers – about 40%. We are very pleased with the results, and we will continue to post multiple times in the week and at the same time, so that our followers have an idea of when to expect news, posts and information about the brand. One thing that we can make to get better engagement is to post a story a few hours before posting a reel or a post. The story will already create some engagement (which will boost our analytics) and we can also announce the post in the story. </li> 
<li>An average of 2 saves per post. This was easy to achieve as most of our content was targeted to be saved. We made several posts with important information which led to even 4 or 5 saves. If we think of creative ways to give this information we could have had even more saves.  
	
	</li>
		  </ul>
			
<p>All in all, we discovered that the secret to successful marketing is a carefully created and prepared content calendar. We successfully posted all of the scheduled content on the content calendar, which allows you to see what needs to be done for the upcoming week. We planned what we wanted to communicate through it every weekend. It relieved the pressure of having to create content at the last minute or forgetting to publish. We scheduled our content on Instagram halfway through our campaign, which helped us remember to post by automatically sending us a reminder each time. Posting at precisely 17:30 was especially useful, as after experimenting with different posting times, this is when we got the most engagement. We discovered that to maintain the viewer's interest until the very end, reels need to have powerful hooks and a valuable or surprising element in the midst. We discovered that including a question in the captions of our posts and reels encourages people to start conversations in the comments. Reels generated the most interaction with our profile, so we discovered that we should concentrate on them. Additionally, we discovered that interactive stories are a great way to engage with our audience and foster loyalty and trust. And it also makes the user experience better. 
		  </p>
			
<h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
			
<p>In order to have clear goals and ensure that the content we create aims to achieve them, if we decide to continue the campaign in the future, we will first set new objectives. Additionally, since the content calendar was very helpful to us during those four weeks, we will create a new one. We were able to reduce the stress of forgetting what and when to post by organising our thoughts and content ahead of time. This allowed us to spend more time engaging with our audience and telling more engaging stories. Reels will be our focus going forward since they attracted the most visitors to our page; however, we'll use more popular Instagram sounds to increase their reach. Because our best-performing reel had both of those, we will also make reels with strong hooks and more information in the caption and video. To encourage participation and spark conversations, we will include questions in our posts that readers can respond to in the comments section. We plan to share more stories featuring polls and interactive questions. To foster loyalty and trust among our audience, we wish to engage with them more. In the future, we would also like to collaborate with influencers to create posts or reels for upcoming events or giveaways. To increase audience anticipation and engagement, we will let the audience know when there are updates to our website or app or when new announcements (like giveaways) will be made. Finally, we will make Instagram Live Q&A in order to interact with our followers. We will do these 2 to 3 times a month. </p> 
			
			<p class="fw-bold">Here are some of our objectives for the future:</p>
			<ul><li>Reach </li>
<ul><li>Reach 2500 accounts by May 1st, 2024.</li> 
<li>Have engagement of 500 accounts by May 1st, 2024. </li>
<li>An average of 1000 views on each reel by May 1st, 2024.</li> 
 </ul>
				<br>
				<li>Affect </li>
<p>By May 1st,2024, we want our audience to be anticipating and involved in our posts by turning on countdown reminders and notifications and participating in polls, quizzes, questions, and direct messages. We want to see our community grow and get more people to join classes and sign-up to our platform.</p>

<h4 class="mt-4">Conclusions, adjustments, and improvements made to the Lean Canvas based on the two rounds of interviews</h4>	
			<br>
			<p class="fw-bold">Conclusions from Problem Interviews: </p>
			During problem interviews, we engaged with potential customers to identify the challenges they face regarding their dog's care and training. Through these interviews, we discovered three primary problems: 

<ol type="A"><li>Busy and Guilty Dog Owners: Owners feel guilty due to lack of time to entertain their dogs adequately, leading to feelings of neglect and concern for their pets' well-being. </li>

<li>Loneliness and Boredom: Dogs experience boredom, sadness, or loneliness due to lack of stimulation and interaction. </li>

<li>Lack of Socialization: Dogs miss out on essential socialization opportunities, leading to behavioral issues and anxiety. </li>
		</ol>	
			<p class="fw-bold">Conclusions from Solution Interviews: </p>
			
	<ul><li>Restricted Flexibility: Those who found it difficult to schedule training sessions and other services, wanted options that were more adaptable to their hectic schedules. </li>

<li>More Customisation: A lot of people expressed a need for additional options when it came to training courses and subscription plans. They believed that in order to better serve their unique wants and preferences, the services have to be more customised. 
</li>
<li>Need for Guarantee: Before committing, people expressed they they want to feel certain and confident in the service. They asked for a free trial option, so that before they subscribe officially, they could try the service and make sure it meets their expectations. 
	</li>		
		  </ul>
		<p class="fw-bold">The changes made after receiving the feedback:</p>

			<ol type="A">
